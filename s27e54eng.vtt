01:21.800 --> 01:24.560
Now they think
he might have sepsis.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.680
But he'll make it, right?

01:26.760 --> 01:29.080
They now have him on a ventilator.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.680
It'll give him a chance to fight it.

01:34.280 --> 01:37.120
-I'm sorry, I have to get back.
-Listen, can I go visit him?

01:37.960 --> 01:40.440
Well, I want to see him.
Especially if he's that bad.

01:40.520 --> 01:44.280
I know, but the girls
are visiting today.

01:44.360 --> 01:47.560
-So maybe it's best you leave it.
-Can't I go in when they're gone?

01:47.640 --> 01:51.120
Mack, there's enough going on
without you adding to the pressure.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.640
Hey, how's John Joe?

01:56.720 --> 01:59.960
-How would I know?
-Geez, don't bite my head off.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.160
Sorry, mate, I'm in a bad way.

02:02.240 --> 02:06.240
My friend is in the hospital
and I can barely ask after him.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.520
-Go in to see him.
-I'm not welcome there.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.400
That bitch Dee will be there.

02:11.480 --> 02:16.960
-Mack Don't mind her.
-Easy for you to say.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.600
Hi, are you around?

02:42.960 --> 02:44.840
-You're joking!
-It's no joke.

02:44.920 --> 02:48.280
It looks like she put it in the oven
and fell asleep.

02:48.360 --> 02:49.840
She was tired, alright.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.080
I know one thing, she and Leonora
would be done for if not for Vera.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.400
Vera?

02:54.480 --> 02:56.320
She was a godsend.

03:03.720 --> 03:06.400
What did the doctors say?

03:06.480 --> 03:09.680
We haven't seen anyone
since the shift change.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.200
Hey, who is John Joe Daly's doctor?

03:16.280 --> 03:18.400
We want his test results.

03:18.480 --> 03:22.120
I don't know, but I know there's
a delay on tests in the lab.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.320
Shouldn't you prioritise
intensive care patients?

03:25.400 --> 03:27.920
-We're doing our best.
-I hope you are.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.840
John Joe's daughter is one of
the best lawyers in the country.

03:30.920 --> 03:35.360
If you make even one mistake,
you'll pay for it.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.640
We are expecting the results soon.

03:37.720 --> 03:41.680
And we're very grateful, doctor.
Thank you.

03:42.720 --> 03:46.560
-What the hell has come over you?
-They're not doing much!

03:46.640 --> 03:47.920
Shut your mouth...

03:48.000 --> 03:51.160
...or they won't do half as much
if you threaten them like that.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.520
Looks like you're in the dog house.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.320
I'm not. Thank God you could come.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.920
I'm not well.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.800
John Joe is in a bad way and I can't
go see him because of that damn Dee.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.320
I need something.

04:17.400 --> 04:20.280
You have to cope with things.
Like I told you before.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.520
-Yeah, I'm trying.
-You need to talk to a counsellor.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.280
I just need something small
to keep me going today.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.120
Come on, what do you say?

04:31.880 --> 04:36.520
Alright, so. I'll give you something
small, but on one condition...

04:36.600 --> 04:38.440
..you have to talk to someone.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.200
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Soon.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.360
Not soon, Mack. Today.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.120
How am I going
to find someone today?

04:46.200 --> 04:50.000
I know someone
and they owe me a favour.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.320
I'll call him now.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.480
Weren't you brave!

04:57.560 --> 05:00.000
I'm sure anyone would have done
the same thing.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.200
Well, you put yourself in danger.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.960
Well, I didn't, really.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.600
But you didn't know
what you were walking into.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.360
Anything could have happened.

05:09.440 --> 05:12.480
Well, thank God everyone
came out of it okay.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.000
Hey.

05:14.080 --> 05:19.560
We're talking about poor Berni
and how Vera saved her and Leonora.

05:19.640 --> 05:25.560
Well, Berni is lucky the apartment
is so near to everyone.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.560
Very easy to drop in on her?

05:27.640 --> 05:29.360
It's too easy, sometimes.

05:29.440 --> 05:34.000
I'd love to do a piece on this
for the radio.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.080
About how Vera came
in the knick of time.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.160
I don't know about that now.

05:39.240 --> 05:42.680
Ah stop! I'm right, no? Wouldn't it
be worth it to interview her?

05:42.760 --> 05:46.640
Of course.
Fair play. She's very lucky.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.360
You could say that again.

05:48.440 --> 05:52.200
If only the smoke alarm
had a battery in it,...

05:52.280 --> 05:54.160
..none of this would have happened.

05:54.240 --> 05:57.720
Thank God everyone's safe.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.560
I have to go but maybe we'll
talk about that interview later on?

06:03.560 --> 06:06.080
I would honestly rather
not say anything about it.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.120
Okay, I'll leave you alone then.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.920
But fair play again.

06:15.240 --> 06:18.080
What a coincidence you were
just in time to save everyone.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.560
What do you mean?

06:19.640 --> 06:23.280
-The camera is still there, right?
-Excuse me?

06:23.360 --> 06:26.600
Were you watching me and John
playing strip poker?

06:26.680 --> 06:28.640
Didn't I tell you
I took the camera out?

06:28.720 --> 06:30.480
Oh, so you're psychic then?

06:30.560 --> 06:33.480
I was going for a visit
when I got a smell of smoke.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.480
-Liar!
-Keep your voice down!

06:36.560 --> 06:38.600
Berni told me to come in at three.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.400
When I do, I'm going to tell
her exactly what you were up to.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.120
Is that how it is now?

06:44.200 --> 06:48.720
And what do you think Berni
will think when you tell her...

06:48.800 --> 06:51.520
..that you've known for ages?

06:51.600 --> 06:53.440
Anyway,...

06:53.520 --> 06:58.640
..you have no camera
to prove what your saying.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.160
Here.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.480
Listen, Noreen,
I'm sorry about earlier.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.920
I shouldn't have spoken
to the doctor like that.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.280
No you shouldn't have.

07:20.360 --> 07:24.320
And you shouldn't have brought
my daughter's name into it either.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.080
I know.

07:26.160 --> 07:29.520
How would you like it if someone
threatened to sue you...

07:29.600 --> 07:31.000
..while trying to do your job?

07:31.080 --> 07:32.280
I know!

07:32.360 --> 07:33.840
I'm just saying...!

07:34.880 --> 07:36.720
This is all my fault.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.200
Aren't you the one who figured out
what beach John Joe was on?

07:40.280 --> 07:44.040
And if you and Imelda hadn't
found him as quickly as you did...!

07:45.720 --> 07:47.880
Well, he'd have died.

07:47.960 --> 07:51.360
But he wouldn't have been
on that beach in the first place...

07:51.440 --> 07:54.640
..if not for me and
that bleeding cleaning!

07:57.760 --> 08:01.800
He was complaining about it
and I just ignored him.

08:03.360 --> 08:06.280
A lot of us just ignored
the poor man.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.880
Yeah, but none of you were training
to be a doctor, were you?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.880
I should have checked him properly.

08:15.440 --> 08:20.080
If he doesn't wake, it's my fault.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.440
Well, you better pray he wakes so.

08:26.920 --> 08:30.760
We'll be drawing portraits of
strangers at the workshop today,...

08:30.840 --> 08:32.680
..which will be different.

08:34.160 --> 08:36.480
What's this for again?

08:36.560 --> 08:38.840
If you were listening to me,
you'd know.

08:38.920 --> 08:41.120
Look at him up there,...

08:41.200 --> 08:45.480
..no shame for the way
he treated his own father.

08:45.560 --> 08:48.160
Oh, he's so stubborn.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.600
-Who's stubborn?
-None of your business.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.720
Don't be like that, Dad.
I did it for you.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.800
Listen here, son,...

08:57.880 --> 09:01.880
..go into business with that idiot
Cóilí Jackie if you like...

09:01.960 --> 09:04.000
..but you're the one who'll suffer.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.920
Stop it, both of you.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.920
You wouldn't know which of you
is the child.

09:10.920 --> 09:14.480
Temper, Dad, temper. You don't want
to embarrass yourself again, do you?

09:17.440 --> 09:20.440
You shouldn't have given him
the satisfaction of talking to him.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.440
I can't let him get away
with it either.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.600
That's not what I'm saying.

09:24.680 --> 09:29.240
Maybe you shouldn't undertake
a big job like that at your age.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.200
That's nonsense!

09:32.280 --> 09:35.280
I can do any kind of job.

09:35.360 --> 09:38.440
And I won't let your likes...

09:38.520 --> 09:42.360
..or the likes of Rory belittle me
or put me down!

09:42.440 --> 09:44.600
My likes?

09:44.680 --> 09:48.280
Well, it's nice to know
where I stand.

09:48.360 --> 09:51.520
-Sadie, I didn't mean...!
-I'm going to the toilet.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.760
You wanted to see me?
Are you okay?

09:57.840 --> 09:59.320
We're fine.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.720
But I need to talk to you.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.200
I'll go back to her.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.400
No. No. I'll go myself.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.280
You stay here.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.880
That's for my meal.

10:34.880 --> 10:38.840
For God's sake,
don't embarrass me.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.680
I'd like to pay my own way,
if you don't mind.

10:41.760 --> 10:45.480
Sadie, I'm really sorry
about what I said earlier.

10:45.560 --> 10:49.440
But it was Rory's doing!

10:49.520 --> 10:51.440
I have to go. I'll be late.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.960
Why don't we spend the rest
of the day together?

10:55.040 --> 10:58.200
I told you I'm doing
portraits later.

10:58.280 --> 11:02.080
Yeah, but couldn't you
do a portrait of me?

11:02.720 --> 11:04.120
I can't.

11:04.200 --> 11:09.440
I would love to have a portrait
of myself to hang up in the office.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.240
What do you say?

11:20.840 --> 11:24.320
-John Joe Daly's family?
-Yes.

11:24.400 --> 11:28.600
It was sepsis from
an untreated wound.

11:28.680 --> 11:32.760
-How bad is it?
-It's pretty bad.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.320
But his temperature was fine.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.560
He might have been taking
a lot of paracetamol,...

11:37.640 --> 11:40.000
..which would mask
a high temperature.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.320
Didn't you ask him about it?

11:47.800 --> 11:52.720
No wonder he asked Conall
over in Miami for help...

11:52.800 --> 11:56.640
..instead of asking the fool
of a son living with him.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.320
Réailtín, what are you doing?

12:05.400 --> 12:08.720
Oh, sorry, I was just looking
for something I left behind.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.520
I know well what you're looking for.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.760
Berni, you're wrong.
I didn't take out the battery.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.440
Hello?

12:35.520 --> 12:37.800
Fine. Come in.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.760
Or maybe your boyfriend
took the battery out.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.360
He wouldn't do something
like that, it was...!

12:47.440 --> 12:50.320
Of course he would and
you're just as guilty, Réailtín,..

12:50.400 --> 12:52.200
..because you let him in my house.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.760
Berni, you shouldn't be angry
at Réailtín.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.280
Yes I should be!
She almost killed us.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.120
She's saying I took the battery
out of the alarm.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.440
But I didn't. Tell her!

13:03.520 --> 13:05.680
How would Vera know who did it?

13:07.160 --> 13:09.040
-But...!
-But nothing, Réailtín!

13:09.120 --> 13:14.000
Get out and don't step foot
in here ever again.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.240
Is anyone hungry?

13:30.240 --> 13:32.560
No, thanks, Mom.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.480
Right, well, I'm going
for a sandwich with Imelda.

13:38.560 --> 13:43.240
Call me as soon as
they're ready to let us in again.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.880
Of course.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.240
I understand
why you're angry with me.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.760
And you're right.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.240
He shouldn't have
had to call Conall.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.000
It's my fault.

14:10.960 --> 14:14.920
Anyway, it's a shame
we had to meet like this.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.640
I've heard a lot of good things
from Dad about you.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.440
Like what?

14:22.440 --> 14:27.640
Well, that you're an amazing lawyer
and that you have a lovely daughter.

14:29.120 --> 14:33.360
I think he only told you
what he wanted to tell you.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.040
As usual.

14:36.240 --> 14:39.760
That's why Mom
told me about you.

14:39.840 --> 14:44.640
Another mistake and secret
he wanted to hide.

14:48.640 --> 14:52.200
-Do you answer your phone at all?!
-Why would I?

14:52.280 --> 14:54.120
You didn't stand up for me
in Berni's.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.840
I didn't know what to say.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.520
I'll talk to her later
after she has calmed down a bit.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.920
Do, and make sure to tell her
John didn't do a thing.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.760
-Are you sure about him?
-Yes, I'm sure!

15:05.840 --> 15:08.560
I called him earlier
and he's really upset.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.480
If something had happened,...

15:10.560 --> 15:13.880
..if someone had died in a fire
in there, we'd be blamed.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.800
Accusations like that would
do real damage.

15:17.880 --> 15:21.880
There's no need for that to happen.
I'm sure Berni will see sense.

15:21.960 --> 15:24.720
How? She's certain we did it.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.760
Unless we could prove
it wasn't us.

15:29.760 --> 15:32.360
-How would you do that?
-With your camera.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.880
Maybe we'd see who took
out the battery.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.640
If you look back on the footage?

15:37.720 --> 15:41.680
That camera was never recording.
It was a livestream.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.920
Sorry.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.200
That's it, so.

15:45.280 --> 15:48.480
Berni won't stop until John and I
are punished for it.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.320
John Joe is awake.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.320
-Thank God.
-That's great!

15:55.400 --> 15:59.440
He has a long road ahead
but if you want to see him, you can.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.400
But it has to be one person
at a time.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.440
-Of course.
-And only family.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.280
That's me, then.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.360
You go get Mom and Imelda.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.040
Rory, come here,
did you hear about John Joe?

16:50.120 --> 16:53.040
-I did. Good news.
-Yeah, thank God.

16:53.120 --> 16:57.160
Oh and that counsellor
wasn't half as bad as I thought.

16:57.240 --> 17:01.240
Good. Fair play for going.
I know that wasn't easy for you.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.600
No, it wasn't, but at least I
got the chance to bitch about Dee.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.760
I suppose you needed that.

17:06.840 --> 17:10.600
As do we all.
Especially when it comes to women!

17:10.680 --> 17:12.800
-Hi, Rory.
-Sonia.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.840
If you're getting another round,
I'll have water this time.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.840
Oh yeah, I'm fine.

17:17.920 --> 17:21.240
I told Colm I'd watch Harry
when we got back.

17:21.320 --> 17:22.960
Just to give him a break.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.240
You're a right saint.

17:25.320 --> 17:28.760
He's the saint letting me and Sam
stay in his house.

17:31.640 --> 17:34.640
You know, I'm really lucky
to have that angel.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.440
Especially with the way
I've been recently.

17:38.440 --> 17:41.680
When you think about it,
most women would have run away.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.720
Thanks again for everything
you did last night.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.920
Yeah, but look...!

17:56.000 --> 18:00.440
Listen, any chance you'd be around
to mind Leonora more often?

18:00.520 --> 18:03.840
Because that little liar isn't going
to babysit for me again,..

18:03.920 --> 18:07.760
..or for anyone else in the village
if I have anything to do with it.

18:07.840 --> 18:13.840
I'd love to, but you shouldn't
get rid of Réailtín that easily.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.320
I know she can be
a little scut sometimes...

18:16.800 --> 18:19.240
..but she never would
have done something like that.

18:19.320 --> 18:22.440
Didn't I see her rummaging
around earlier?

18:22.520 --> 18:26.480
And I caught her and her boyfriend
with a box of cigarettes in here.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.560
They weren't smoking in here, Berni.

18:28.640 --> 18:33.240
-How would you know, Vera?
-Because Réailtín told me.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.080
Did Réailtín ask you
to come here on her behalf?

18:37.160 --> 18:39.160
Réailtín doesn't even know I'm here.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.920
But I'm certain it wasn't them.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.680
But how?

18:43.760 --> 18:45.560
Because...!

18:46.720 --> 18:48.760
I saw who did it.

18:49.760 --> 18:54.440
If you did, tell me who it was!

18:55.760 --> 18:57.160
Caitríona.

18:59.560 --> 19:02.840
Caitríona came in
to water the plants.

19:02.920 --> 19:07.320
Caitríona was staying here
while you were gone.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.480
The alarm was making noise
because the battery was going...

19:10.560 --> 19:12.240
..so she took it out.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.280
How do you know all of this?

19:16.280 --> 19:18.040
Because...!

19:18.120 --> 19:22.240
Because I saw the whole thing
taking place...

19:22.320 --> 19:24.280
..on a camera.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.800
What's happening now?

19:29.880 --> 19:35.160
Well, Imelda is finally out
and Katy is going in.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.720
We better wait if that's the case.

19:38.800 --> 19:42.720
Aye, she'll keep yapping away
for another while anyway.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.920
That's how she always was with him.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.400
That's true.

19:53.360 --> 19:58.920
Do you remember when he'd play horsy
with us when we were young?

20:00.360 --> 20:03.680
Only when the dishes had to be done,
if I remember correctly.

20:05.960 --> 20:11.760
She'd always get more trips around
the house than we would.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.880
Because she wouldn't let go
of his neck.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.240
He had you all spoilt.

20:17.320 --> 20:21.280
That's what he'd rather do
than help you with your homework.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.680
Listen, I'm going to go.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.520
You haven't seen him yet!

20:25.600 --> 20:27.840
It doesn't matter.
I'll see him tomorrow.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.800
-He'll want to see you today.
-I don't know about that.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.520
When Dad remembers
it was all his fault?

20:38.440 --> 20:42.880
Listen, Manus, if you think what
happened is your fault,...

20:42.960 --> 20:45.800
..maybe you should talk to him.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.640
I don't think it's a good time.

20:49.720 --> 20:53.200
Well, when it comes to this
family,...

20:53.280 --> 20:56.200
..you have no choice but
to deal with things straight away.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.040
Or else it'll only get worse.

20:59.920 --> 21:05.240
I didn't set it up to spy on you
but to keep you safe.

21:06.240 --> 21:09.880
After Briain almost killed
that nurse.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.760
To keep us safe?

21:12.760 --> 21:14.560
What rubbish!

21:15.520 --> 21:18.360
What sort of person
would do something like that?

21:18.440 --> 21:23.440
The same person who heard
a lot of lies from you and Tony.

21:24.760 --> 21:27.960
I loved that little girl
before she was even born.

21:28.960 --> 21:34.080
And it broke my heat when he said
I was nothing to me.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.360
I know it was wrong of us
to do that.

21:38.360 --> 21:44.400
But that doesn't mean you can go
and set up a camera in my apartment!

21:44.480 --> 21:48.320
But I did it for you!
Even though it was wrong.

21:48.400 --> 21:53.480
But it made me so happy
to see that little girl.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.760
Look, I don't want to hear that.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.520
Go and get the camera.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.520
Now!

22:14.640 --> 22:17.040
The camera is in this teddy.

22:19.160 --> 22:20.960
Give it to me!

22:21.040 --> 22:23.520
That camera isn't leaving here.

22:24.520 --> 22:27.480
And give me the key you used
to come in.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.560
Please, Berni.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.080
Now go.

22:35.160 --> 22:41.120
You will have nothing to do with me
or my daughter ever again.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.680
Manus.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.040
You're looking better.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.240
Listen, Dad,
I'm sorry about all of this.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.440
If I hadn't played that joke on
Mack's car,...

23:03.520 --> 23:07.360
..we wouldn't have argued and you
wouldn't have gotten that damn cut!

23:09.080 --> 23:10.720
Because I was angry with you...

23:10.800 --> 23:14.440
..I didn't even realise you
were taking something for the pain.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.120
I've done nothing but
cause you trouble since I arrived.

23:17.200 --> 23:20.680
You nearly died because of me!
What kind of a son does that?

23:25.480 --> 23:26.920
My son.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.800
Dad!

23:30.880 --> 23:35.040
-Come here, old fella.
-Conall!
