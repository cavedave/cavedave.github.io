There is an idea called <a href="https://hugofara.github.io/lwt/">Learning with Texts</a> (and commercially <a href="https://www.lingq.com/en/">lingq</a>, but no Irish language here) where you learn languages faster
  with audio, the text in the target language and ideally something to keep track of new words to you. <p></p>
  What I am trying to make here is something like <a href="https://genius.com/Neil-young-and-crazy-horse-cortez-the-killer-lyrics">genius.com</a> 
but it takes a <a href="https://www.tg4.ie/en/player/play/?pid=6092876589001&title=Ros%20na%20R%C3%BAn&series=Ros%20na%20R%C3%BAn&genre=Drama&pcode=097325
">Ros na Rún</a> episode, the audio from it, and the English and Irish vtt subtitle files. <p></p>And makes a page you can listen back to an episode on with the script and when you come across a bit you don't understand hover over to see the English.
<p></p>
and up your language learning with that practice.
